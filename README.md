# React Challenge #001 for Jungle Devs

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

**Challenge goal**: The purpose of this challenge is to give a general idea of how React works and how you can use it to create simple reactive applications. You’ll be implementing a simplified version of Hapu’s ‘Become a Nanny Share Host’ view. The concepts that you’re gonna apply are:

-   JSX;
-   Components, props and state;
-   Lifecycle Methods;
-   Responsive design with CSS media-queries;
-   API calls;
-   Error handling;
-   Loading states;
-   SEO & accessibility;
-   A/B tests;
-   Production builds.

**Final accomplishment**: By the end of this challenge you'll have a production ready build.
